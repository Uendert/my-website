:material-hand-wave: Welcome!

I'm **Uendert Andrade**, a **Leinweber Postdoctoral Fellow** at the **University of Michigan**, working within the Leinweber Institute for Theoretical Physics (LITP). 

I am a cosmologist working at the intersection of **observational and theoretical cosmology**, focusing on galaxy clustering, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and tests of gravity with large-scale structure data.
